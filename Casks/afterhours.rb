  caveats <<~EOS
    Afterhours isn't notarized yet, so macOS blocks it the first time.
    Open System Settings > Privacy & Security and click Open Anyway.

    Upgrading quits Afterhours, which lets a closed Mac sleep.
    Upgrade with the lid open.

    Before `brew uninstall --zap`, remove Claude Code hooks in
    Settings > Agents and hubs in Settings > Limits.
